## Application design

### Technology Overview
This application has been developed using jQuery

The application styling was done through Tailwind CSS without the need for any separate stylesheets

### Design Logic
The application has three different components that are toggled on display depending on the status of the application

1. The start page. This page is displayed initially and only initially when the application has been first loaded.
2. The main game page. This page is displayed as the player is playing the game.
3. The end of game page that allows for the player to replay. This page is displayed when the player makes a mistake or runs out of time.

The application allows the player 3 seconds to start after the application demonstrate the next color of the pattern

The application tracks the player's highest score through local storage
